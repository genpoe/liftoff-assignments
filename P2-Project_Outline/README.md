# Project Outline
## To-Dog List  
### Overview
To-do lists are an incredibly useful tool for everything from massive projects to daily chores, but they're not very exciting or interesting. Many people find satisfaction in ticking the boxes on their list, but others need more motivation, especially for less desired tasks. **To-Dog List** aims to solve both of those problems. When a task is marked as complete in To-Dog List, the user will be rewarded with a random picture of a dog. This may seem trivial to some people, but reward systems and visual reinforcement are shown to be very effective motivational strategies, especially with children (or anyone who loves dogs!). Being given a picture that elicits a positive reaction will motivate users to both write down their tasks in the app where it will be saved for them (no forgetting a task or losing the list) *and* follow through on completing the tasks, leading to increased productivity and higher self-esteem.
